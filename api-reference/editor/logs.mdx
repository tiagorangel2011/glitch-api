title: 'Get logs'
openapi: 'GET wss://api.glitch.com/{projectid}/logs'
---

This endpoint controls the Glitch editor using WebSockets, so it might be a bit more difficult to understand. May change soon.

To use this endpoint, open the following websocket:

```
wss://api.glitch.com/{projectid}/logs?authorization={persistent_token}
```

<Note>
You must send a message with `keep alive` every few seconds, otherwise the connection will be closed.
</Note>

Logs should look like this:

```json
{
   "process":"signal",
   "timestamp":123456789,
   "text":"xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

To test this endpoint, we recommend you using something like Hoppscotch.
