## About

This is an unofficial documentation for the Glitch API: the API Glitch uses to do a ton of stuff on their frontend, e.g. read a project's information, search for users, etc.

## Authentication

Most of the endpoints need to be authenticated using a persistent token in the `Authorization` header.

To get it, go to [Glitch](https://glitch.com), open the devtools console (press `CTRL+SHIFT+I`, you might need to type `allow pasting`) and run this code:

```javascript
prompt("Token:", JSON.parse(localStorage.cachedUser).persistentToken)
```

This will show open a window with your persistent token. It should look like this:

```
xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx
```
