## About

This is an unofficial documentation for the Glitch API: the API Glitch uses to do a ton of stuff on their frontend, e.g. read a project's information, search for users, etc.

This documentation's objective is to be the most detailed and with most endpoints of all Glitch API documentations. Made with Mintlify for nice UI and interactive widgets.

Credit to https://glitchapi.js.org and [Snail](https://github.com/wh0/snail-cli) for some endpoints.

<Note>
Glitch is starting to rolling out [webhooks](https://support.glitch.com/t/community-test-glitch-thanked-webhook/65338) in the [community test website](https://preview.glitch.com/).

Once more webhooks are added, we recommend using them over this.

## Authentication

Most of the endpoints need to be authenticated using a persistent token in the `Authorization` header.

To get it, go to [Glitch](https://glitch.com), open the devtools console (press `CTRL+SHIFT+I`, you might need to type `allow pasting`) and run this code:

```javascript
prompt("Token:", JSON.parse(localStorage.cachedUser).persistentToken)
```

This will show open a window with your persistent token. It should look like this:

```
xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxxx
```
