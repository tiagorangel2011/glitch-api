# Unofficial Glitch API

</div>

This is an unofficial documentation for the Glitch API: the API Glitch uses to do a ton of stuff on their frontend, e.g. read a project's information, search for users, etc.

This documentation's objective is to be the most detailed and with most endpoints of all Glitch API documentations. Made with Mintlify for nice UI and interactive widgets.

Credit to https://glitchapi.js.org and SnailCLI for some endpoints.
